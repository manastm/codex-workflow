# Project Agents & Workflow

This file defines the workflow rules and process for development sessions using Codex CLI.

## Session Process

### 1. Planning Phase
- **Understand**: Read the objective and analyze required scope
- **Context**: Review existing architecture, patterns, and constraints
- **Plan**: Create a detailed implementation plan with clear steps
- **Estimate**: Assess complexity and time requirements

### 2. Implementation Phase
- **Document**: Log key decisions and reasoning as you work
- **Test**: Verify functionality with appropriate testing
- **Review**: Check code quality and adherence to project standards
- **Iterate**: Refine based on feedback and testing results

### 3. Completion Phase
- **Summarize**: Document what was accomplished
- **Clean**: Remove temporary files and clean up workspace
- **Next Steps**: Identify follow-up tasks or considerations
- **Update**: Ensure all documentation is current

## Code Quality Standards

- **Follow existing patterns**: Match the project's coding style and architecture
- **Write tests**: Include appropriate test coverage for new functionality
- **Document decisions**: Explain why choices were made, not just what was done
- **Keep it simple**: Prefer readable, maintainable solutions over clever ones

## Communication

- **Be explicit**: State assumptions and constraints clearly
- **Ask questions**: Clarify requirements when anything is unclear
- **Show progress**: Update status and provide regular check-ins
- **Share context**: Help others understand your reasoning and approach
